# Flights Analysis
## ‚úà  Overview
A project analyzing and visualizing flight data from 14 airlines using R. 

For the analysis I'll be using the following factors to determine airline performance:  
1. Flight Volume, 
2. Flight Travel Distance, 
3. Flight Cancellation Percent,
4. Flight Delay Count
5. Flight Diverted Count
6. Flight Route Diversity

Additionally, I analyze airline performance for Hawaiian Airlines specifcally when compared to the other airlines using:
1. Flight Travel Distance
2. Flight Cancellation Percent
3. Flight Delay Count
4. Flight Route Diversity
